<p>Biography:
  Maxim R. Bayan is a soil scientist, clay mineralogist, and an environmental
  geochemist. He has doctorate degrees in both soil and geological sciences. His
  undergraduate degrees are in agricultural engineering and computer science
  and information technology. He received his education in the United States
  from Iowa State University and the University of Kentucky. Shortly after his
  academic training he started an environmental engineering company named
  The E-TEC Group, LLC (Environmental Testing, Engineering, and Consulting). In
  2010, he joined the faculty of Lincoln University to devote his life to research
  and teaching of basic agricultural and environmental concepts to socially underadvantaged students.
   In a short period, since his return to academics, the
  significance of his research was recognized by the International Biochar
  Initiative (IBI) and was selected to serve on its advisory board.  He started Biochar Star in
  2017 to edcuate the public on biochar and sell proucts that promote the use of biochar.  </p>
